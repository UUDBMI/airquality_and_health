Air quality has major impact on health. In addition to agitating the respiratory system, air pollutants have effects on the cardiovascular system and has been linked to pre-term birth. Addressing the health effects due to air pollution has implications for individual health care, population health, and public policy. In this module we will explore the various factors that influence air quality.

This module will expose you to the various data sources, methodologies, health effects, and policies surrounding air quality.

## Impact of Geography

Because of its geography, the Salt Lake Valley, similar to many other valleys in the Great Basin, faces particular challenges with air quality.
